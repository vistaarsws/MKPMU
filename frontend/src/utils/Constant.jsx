The Newaj River, originating from Sehore district, travels 220 km before joining the Chambal River. The Newaj sub-basin covers a drainage area of 4,290 km², which accounts for 7.2% of the Chambal basin's total drainage area within Madhya Pradesh. The location of the Mohanpura dam is strategically positioned within this basin to optimize water resource management for irrigation and other uses. The Mohanpura Irrigation Project (MIP) was initiated to meet the agricultural water demands of the Newaj sub-basin and neighboring Parbati and Kalisindh sub-basins, aiming to irrigate 210,000 hectares. While 877 Mm³ of water was required, only 616 Mm³ of gross storage, including 572.96 Mm³ of live water, could be created through the Mohanpura Dam. Conventionally, this could irrigate only 87,000 hectares. To bridge this gap, MIP adopted a Pressurized Irrigation Network (PIN), increasing efficiency to serve 145,661 hectares, while also addressing drinking, environmental, and industrial needs. The project integrates automated control systems for optimal water distribution, with sub-projects at various stages of completion.",
